Coding Guidelines
========
* Whenever using files from an external source, copy them over into our repository. This makes it faster to debug (since the files are called locally), and avoids any issues with changes made to the external source.

* Put any scripts and libraries from external sources in the /scripts folder

* Use non-minified versions whenever possible, as this makes it easier to debug errors.
