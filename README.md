Freebeer
========
`Freebeer` is a demo GUI front end to the Puffball project. 

Puffball is a decentralized discussion platform. Front end web & mobile developers can create their own GUI front end to Puffball, using the Puffball API, to host their own Puffball server. All user content is encrypted via the Blockchain, allowing a secure & decentralized social platform for sharing of text, audio, video and images.

`Freebeer` currently reads data from a sample JSON file so GUI development can continue in parallel with Puffball's API team. Once Puffball's API is released Freebeer will connect to the live API. 

Freebeer and Puffball are currently in Phase 1 of the Development roadmap. The TODO list is located on Trello: https://trello.com/puffball

Please see the [guide to the puffball platform](http://extrazoom.com/image-10847.html) This guide visually outlines Puffball usage and provides an overview of the development roadmap, user accounts/naming, user generated content, the Blockchain, and the Freebeer demo GUI.
