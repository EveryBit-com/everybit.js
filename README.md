Freebeer
========
Freebeer is a demo GUI front end to the Puffball project. 

Puffball is a decentralized discussion platform. Anyone, anywhere can create their own GUI front end to Puffball and host their own front end to the discussions available in the Puffball BlockChain. 

Freebeer currently reads data from a sample JSON file so development can continue in parallel with Puffball's API team. Once Puffball's API is released Freebeer will consume the live API. 

Puffball's GitHub page is here:

The main Puffball site is here:
