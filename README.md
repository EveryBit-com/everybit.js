===========
EveryBit's powerful API gives your web application fully functioning encrypted messaging and user management in a few short lines of code.

Currenly if you want to provide your users with private multimedia messaging you usually have to rely on external services like facebook or twitter. The same goes for managing usernames and passwords. This means you have to rely on the responsibility of a third party to manage your users sensitive data. With EveryBit, all private user data is encrypted using the same algorithms used by popular services such as bitcoin, meaning that even if it was stolen or intercepted in transit it would still be fully protected. EveryBit makes it so that only your users and their intended recipients can view content that is sent.

Getting started with EveryBit is easy and if you're on the fence feel free to check out our in depth Docs page that describe exactly how our system keeps your users' data safe from hackers, shady government organizations and large corperate entities.
