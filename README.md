===========
EveryBit's powerful API gives your web application fully secure encrypted messaging and user management in just a few lines of code.

Currently if you want to provide your users with private text messaging and file sending you have to rely on external services like Facebook, or build your own system. The same goes for managing usernames and passwords. This means you have to rely on a third party to manage your user's sensitive data. With EveryBit, all private data is encrypted using ECC and ECDH (see the Crypto section below for a summary) on the client side before sending over the network. Only your users and their intended recipients can view content that is sent. You cannot view the encrypted content your users send to each other.

### Crypto
A short summary of our process for Alice to encrypt a message for Bob and Charlie:

Alice creates a fully-formed puff (our data protocol) and converts it into a JSON string (aka the letter). Alice then generates a random 256-bit AES key (aka the message key) and uses it to encrypt the letter. 

She then uses her private ECC key and Bob's public ECC key to generate a shared secret using ECDH. A 256-bit AES key is generated by taking a SHA256 hash of the shared secret. This AES key is used to encrypt the message key, so that Bob can later decrypt the message key and then decrypt the message. 

Alice repeats the message key encryption procedure for Charlie, then packages the message and the encrypted keys into a new puff (aka the envelope).

If Alice desires a higher level of privacy she can create a one-time-use anonymous user and have that anonymous user create the envelope instead of doing it herself. Then the letter inside is still signed using her private key via ECDSA, so Bob and Charlie can tell it's actually from Alice once they've decrypted the letter, but the envelope itself has no features which point back to her.

She can also create a second anonymous user as a reply-to address, to prevent information from leaking via the reply chain.
